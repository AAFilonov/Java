/*2. Write a program that reads an integer angle (which may be positive or negative)
        and normalizes it to a value between 0 and 359 degrees. Try it first with the %
        operator, then with floorMod.
        3. Using only the conditional operator, write a program that reads three integers and
        prints the largest. Repeat with Math.max.
        4. Write a program that prints the smallest and largest positive double values.
        Hint: Look up Math.nextUp in the Java API*/
